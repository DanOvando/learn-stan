# Bayesian vs. Frequentist

.pull-left[

### Bayes

Data are fixed, parameters are random

What is the probability of a model given the data?

- e.g. conditional on my model and data, how likely is it that a stock is overfished?

Clean way to bring in prior knowledge

But, means you have to think about priors

] .pull-right[

### Frequentist

Data are random, parameters are fixed

How likely are the observed data if a given model is true?

What you probably learned in stats classes.

Can't really say anything about the probability of a parameter. 

No need to think about priors


]

# A Likelihood Refresher

Likelihoods and model fitting are an entire course, but we need some common language to move forward. 

What's missing from this regression equation?

$$y_i = \beta{x_i}$$


--

$$y_i = \beta{x_i} + \epsilon_i$$

 What do we generally assume about the error term $\epsilon_i$?
 
--
 
 OLS assumes that errors are I.I.D; independent and identically distributed
 
 $$\epsilon_i \sim normal(0,\sigma)$$

 

---

# A Likelihood Refresher


Another way to write that model is a data-generating model

$$y_i \sim normal(\beta{x_i},\sigma)$$


This means that the likelihood ( P(data|model)) can be calculated as

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2{\pi}\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(\beta{x_i} - y)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Or for those of you that prefer to speak code

`dnorm(y,beta * x, sigma)`

Most model fitting revolves around finding parameters that maximize likelihoods!
---


# I thought you said I needed a prior?

What we just looked at is a regression estimated via maximum likelihood (would get same result by OLS). 

To go Bayes, you need to specify priors on all parameters. 

What are the parameters of this model?

$$y_i \sim normal(\beta{x_i},\sigma)$$

--

We can use these priors for the parameters

$$\beta \sim normal(0,2.5)$$

$$\sigma \sim cauchy(0,2.5)$$

And so our posterior (no longer just likelihood) is proportional to

`dnorm(y,beta * x, sigma) x dnorm(beta,0, 2.5) X dcauchy(sigma,0,2.5)`

???
why only proportional?

notice a bit of a dirty secret here: the priors have to stop somewhere.

# A Quick Note on Priors

"Best" case scenario
  - You can include the results of another study as priors in yours

You usually know *something*
  - What's your prior on the average length of a whale?
  
Does get harder for more esoteric parameters
  - A uniform prior is NOT UNINFORMATIVE
  
(informative) Data quickly overwhelm priors

When in doubt, check sensitivity to different priors

  - If your key results depend on priors, be prepared to defend them

# Breath. 


.pull-left[

If that all made you a little queasy, don't worry, we're back to code!

This can seem like deep stuff, but I really find it easier than the frequentist stats I was trained on. 

The problem becomes more about making models of the world than remember what test goes with what kind of problem. 

I can't recommend these two books enough.

# Basics of Bayes - MCMC


Big reason that Bayes wasn't historically used as much was that except for some specific cases Bayesian models have no analytical solution (and debates about priors)
  
  - Frequentist can usually solve for the answer (given some very specific assumptions)


Started to change when computers made Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) practical
  - Monte Carlo - try lots of different numbers
  
  - Markov Chain - an elegant way of choosing those numbers

# Basics of Bayes - MCMC

MCMC can be shown to always converge! 

Sounds like magic, but basically says, "If you try every number in existence, you'll find the solution"

# Enter Stan (and Hamilton!)

Was going to insert a Hamilton joke here, but full disclosure, I've never seen or heard Hamilton, so decided against it. 

Stan uses a very elegant method called Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with a No-U-turn sampler (NUTs) to help Bayesian models converge quickly with relatively clear diagnostics. 

We don't have time to go into it, but trust me, it's cool. See [Monnahan et al. 2018](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12681)

# Bayesian regression with `rstanarm`

Bayesian methods traditionally required writing your own code of the model. Made running say a regression pretty annoying. 
  
  - No one wants to run JAGS when `lm(y ~ x)` is on the table

`rstanarm` was developed to reduce the "it's a pain" reason for not using Bayesian regressions

  - Modification of classic "applied regression modeling" (`arm`) package

---


# Bayesian regression with `rstanarm`

```{r, echo = FALSE, result = "asis"}

# Bayesian regression with `rstanarm`

Let's start with a simple model: predict log(life expectancy) as a function of log(gdp)

  geom_point()

                                 data = gapminder,
                                 refresh = 1000,

# Digging into `rstanarm`

`rstanarm` function regression functions start with `stan_<model typs>`

  - `stan_glm`
  - `stan_glmer`
  - `stan_gamm4`
  - `stan_lm`
  
In most ways the syntax etc. works the same as the ML versions: going from a standard binominal glm to a Bayesian as as simple as

`glm(diagnosis ~ traits, data = data, family = binomial())`

`stan_glm(diagnosis ~ traits, data = data, family = binomial())`


---

# Digging into `rstanarm`

This isn't the class to learn `glm`s / hierarchical modeling (see the books I keep plugging)

What we will go over are some of the stan-specific options and diagnostics that apply across any model type you're using



---

# Key `stan` options

.pull-left[

`iter`: # of iterations per chain

`warmup`: # of iter to use in warmup

`chains`: # of chains to run

`cores`: # of parallel cores to run chains on

`max_treedepth`: controls how far the model will look for a new proposal before giving up
  <!-- - higher values allow model to explore a flatter posterior -->

`adapt_delta`: the target rate that new proposals are accepted
  <!-- - higher means the model takes smaller steps -->

`seed` sets the seed for the run
] .pull-right[

```{r, results="hide"}

simple_lifexp_model <- rstanarm::stan_glm(
  log(lifeExp) ~ log(gdpPercap),
  data = gapminder,
  iter = 2000,
  warmup = 1000,
  chains = 1,
  cores = 1,
  prior = normal(),
  control =
    list(max_treedepth = 15,
         adapt_delta = 0.8),
  seed = 42
)


```


]


---


# iter, warmup, and chains

The # of kept iterations you keep is `iter` - `warmup`

  - No need to thin! (though you can)
  
Balance between long enough to tune HMC / explore posterior, short enough to be fast. `warmup` defaults to half of `iter`

Sometimes slower is faster: giving stan enough iterations to warmup properly can actually be faster than trying to go with small number of iterations. 


Best practice with any kind of MCMC is to run multiple chains
  - If working, should all converge to the same place
  - 4 is a good number
  - Chains can be run in parallel, but have startup costs
    - If model is really fast, parallel may be slower

---

# `treedepth` and `adapt_delta`


`treedepth` controls how many steps the NUTS sampler will take before giving up on finding a new value (at which time it will go back to where it started). Increasing this can helpful if the posterior is really flat.

`adapt_delta` controls how small the step sizes are. The higher `adapt_delta` is, the higher the target acceptance rate is, and therefore the smaller the step size. 

  - Basically, if the posterior has lots of small nooks and crannies, a low `adapt_delta` might result in step sizes that jump right over those points. 
  
  - This will produce a "divergence" warning, which is not good
  
  - stan will suggest increasing `adapt_delta` if that happens

# Setting Priors


```{r, eval = FALSE}

simple_lifexp_model <- rstanarm::stan_glm(
  log(lifeExp) ~ log(gdpPercap),
  data = gapminder)

```

I thought you said Bayes requires priors? I don't see any in that regression. 

`rstanarm` has some pretty clever selectors for [weakly informative priors](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html)

---

# Setting Priors

```{r}

rstanarm::prior_summary(simple_lifexp_model)

```

---

# Setting Priors

You can adjust these, and Stan recommends explicitly setting them since defaults may change. 

see `rstanarm::priors`

```{r}

lifexp_model  <-
  stan_glm(
    log(lifeExp) ~ log(gdpPercap),
    data = gapminder,
    refresh = 0,
    prior = normal(autoscale = TRUE), # prior on the model coefficients
    prior_intercept = normal(autoscale = TRUE), # prior for any intercepts
    prior_aux = exponential(autoscale = TRUE) # in the case prior sigma
  )


```

# Setting Priors

Suppose I have a firm belief GDP is completely uncorrelated with life expectancy.
```{r}

# Exercise

# Exercise - Priors

Try out a couple different kinds of priors

  - How informative do they have to be before they start substantially affecting results?
  
  - How does this change as you reduce the sample size of the data?
  
  - Look at `?rstanarm::priors`
  
  - Test out the effect of different distributions for the priors

---

# Diagnosing `stan` fits

`rstanarm` is just calling `stan` in the background. 

This means that all the same diagnostics apply whether you're using `rstan`, `rstanarm`, `brms`, or any of the other `stan` packages. 

Things like `lm` will always "work"

Numerical optimizers like HMC have no such guarantee
  * You need to make sure the algorithm has converged

Stan has numerous built-in diagnostics to help you do this. 

---

# Key `stan` Diagnostics - Divergences

Divergences are the big one to watch out for. 

Divergences are a warning that the model has missed some part of the parameter space (they're a handy product of the math behind HMC). 

Chains with large numbers of divergences probably have unreliable results. 

Simplest solution is to increase `adapt_delta`, which will slow down the model some. 

If divergences persist, try increasing the warmup period, and if that fails, you probably need to think about the structure of your model. 

A few divergences may still pop up once in a while: This doesn't automatically mean that your model doesn't work, but you should explore further to see what's going on. Thinning a model with a few divergences out of thousands of iterations can help. 

---

# Key `stan` Diagnostics - `max_treedepth`

The `max_treedepth` parameter of a Stan model controls the maximum number of steps that the NUTS algorithm will take in search of a new proposal. 

Getting lots of `max_treedepth exceeded` warnings means that the algorithm hit the max number of steps rather than finding where the trajectory of the parameter space doubles back on itself. 

This is more of an efficiency problem than a fundamental model fitting problem like divergences. 

Solutions include increasing `max_treedepth`, and trying a longer warmup period, and reparameterizing the model.


---


# More Key `stan` Diagnostics

* R-hat

Measures whether all the chains have mixed for each parameter. Parameters with high R-hat values probably haven't converged

* Bulk ESS

Measures the effective sample size of each parameter. Too low suggests you might need more iterations, a better parameterization, or some thinning


* Energy

E-BFMI is a measure of the warmup success. A warning here suggests you might need a model reparameterization or just need a longer warmup. 

**THESE ARE ALL ROUGH APPROXIMATIONS SEE [here](https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html) FOR MORE DETAILS**

# Diagnosing stan models

<!-- This is one of the nicest features of Bayesian analysis: the diagnostics are more or less the same no matter what kind of model you're fitting.  -->

Stan has numerous built in functions for looking at these diagnostics, and will even include helpful suggestions about them! They generally stat with `rstan::check_<something>`

```{r}

rstan::check_hmc_diagnostics(lifexp_model$stanfit)

```

---


# Diagnosing with shinystan

The built-in functions are great for diagnosing large numbers of models, make plots, etc. 

Stan also comes with a built in model visualizer called `shinystan` that allows you to explore all standard model diagnostics, as well as lots of other features

# Analyzing Results


So far we've covered the bare bones basics of how to fit and care for a Stan model. 

The objective of all that model fitting is to look at our results and make inference!

We're now going to look at how to do that with stan models. 

Similar to the diagnostics, these apply to any kind of stan model.

---


# Where are my results??

For `rstanarm` models, a lot of the standard methods for getting summary results from regressions work (e.g. `broom::tidy()`)

```{r}
lifexp_model %>% broom.mixed::tidy()
```

I'm not going to focus on those here. Instead we're going to look at methods for extracting and visualizing results from any stan model. 


---

# `rstan::extract`

Our simple model has two parameters: `(Intercept)` and `log(gdpPercap)`

  listviewer::jsonedit()

  select(1:5) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, format = "html")

# Writing models in `stan`

`rstanarm` is great and helps make Bayesian regressions just as easy as `lm/glm/gamm` etc. 

Hopefully you've also seen that Bayesian models can make statistical inference MUCH simpler. 

Lots of times though, we want to move beyond linear regression. Bayesian estimation through HMC is particularly good at estimating really complex models. 

For that, you may need to write your own stan code
  - [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) is a great package for writing non-linear models in stan without writing the stan code. Not going to cover here

# Stan

Stan is a programming language written in C++, with a lot of "sugar" to make your life easier. 

But, it is still a compiled language. This means that unlike R / Python, you can't just run it line by line in an IDE. 

This makes it much faster, but also a little tougher to get going. 

But, the good news is that you can use R for all your pre-and-post model wrangling, and Stan for just the model fitting.

# Anatomy of a .stan file

Best way is to write a Stan model is create a new .stan file. 

Each stan model is broken into blocks

```{stan, eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}

data{
# declare data being passed to the model
}
parameters{
# declare parameters to be estimated
}
transformed parameters{
# apply transformations to parametres (e.g log)
}
model{
# define the statistical parameters
}
generated quantities{
# calculate things like posterior predictives
}


```

# General stan syntax

For the most part, most things work like they do in R!
  - e.g. `for`, `if`, `while` work exactly the same
  - `x[1,1:5]` gives the first five columns of the first row of x
  - Things are indexed at 1!
  
Major differences

  - It's C++, so everything has to end with `;`
  
  - You have to explicitly declare types and dimensions
    - This is usually the hardest part for people

We'll practice this by filling in a model
```{stan, output.var = "test", eval = FALSE}
real x;
x = 2 + 2;
```

# The Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
arfloundbsai <- read_rds(here::here("data","ARFLOUNDBSAI.rds"))

flound <- arfloundbsai$data[[1]]  %>% 
  na.omit() 

flound %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ssb, recruits)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21, fill = "steelblue") + 
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,NA))

```

---

# data block

Anything being passed from R to stan goes in here

Remember you need to declare both type and dimensions!

```{stan, eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}
data{
int<lower = 1> n; //number of observations

vector[n] spawners; // vector of spawners

vector[n] recruits; // vector of recruits
}
```

---

# The Model

We're going to fit a simple Beverton-Holt Spawner-Recruit model to these data. 

$$recruits \sim logn(\frac{(0.8 \times r0 \times h \times s)}{ (0.2 \times s0 \times (1 - h) +(h - 0.2) \times s)},\sigma)$$

  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
h <-  0.7
r0 <- max(flound$recruits) * .5
ssb0 <- max(flound$ssb) * .75

flound$pred <- (0.8 * r0 * h * flound$ssb) / (0.2 * ssb0 * (1 - h) + (h - 0.2) * flound$ssb)


flound %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(ssb, recruits),size = 4) +
  geom_line(aes(ssb, pred, color = "Model guess"),size = 1.5) + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "") + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), name = "Spawners") + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Recruits") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

---


# transformed data block
All objects must be declared in the first part of a block
```{stan, eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}
transformed data{
vector[n] log_recruits; // log recruitment
log_recruits = log(recruits);
}
```

---

# parameter block

The parameter block is where you declare things the model will estimate. 

Notice that stan lets you declare bounds in here!

```{stan, eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}
parameters{
real<lower = 0.2, upper = 1> h; //steepness
real log_r0; // unfished recruitment
real log_s0; // unfished spawners
real<lower = 0> sigma;
}
```


---

# transformed parameter block

Consider a population model: The biomass over time if just a transformation of the parameters. 

By default stan still return draws from things in the transformed parameters

```{stan, eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}
transformed parameters{
vector[n] recruits_hat;
vector[n] log_recruits_hat;
real r0;
real s0;
r0 = exp(log_r0);
s0 = exp(log_s0);
recruits_hat = (0.8 * r0 * h * spawners) ./ (0.2 * s0 * (1 - h) +(h - 0.2) * spawners);
log_recruits_hat = log(recruits_hat);
}
```
---


# model block

This is where you write your *statistical* model 

Things created in `model` block are only visible in `model` block
  - Trade-off between output usability/clarity

**You can't put priors on transformed parameters**
.footnote[without some voodoo]

```{stan  eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}
model{
log_recruits ~ normal(log_recruits_hat - 0.5 * sigma^2, sigma); // bias correction
sigma ~ cauchy(0,2.5);
log_s0 ~ normal(15,2);
log_r0 ~ normal(8,2);
h ~ beta(6,2);
}
```

---

# generated quantities

This is mostly used for generating posterior predictives. 

Note the R-like syntax of most things

```{stan eval = FALSE, output.var = "scratch"}
generated quantities{
  vector[n] pp_rhat;
  for (i in 1:n) {
   pp_rhat[i] = exp(normal_rng(log_recruits_hat[i] - 0.5 * sigma^2, sigma));
  }
}

```

---


# Fitting the Model

Once you've written the model, you just need to pass it to `rstan::stan`

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

chains <- 4

inits <- list(s0 = max(flound$ssb) * 1.5, r0 = max(flound$recruits), h = 0.7)

inits <- map(1:chains,~ map(inits, jitter,1))

bh_fit <- rstan::stan(
  file = here::here("src","bh_model.stan"),
  data = list(spawners = flound$ssb,
              recruits = flound$recruits,
              n = length(flound$ssb)),
  init = inits,
  chains = chains,
  cores = 1, 
  iter = 10000,
  refresh = 0
)
```

---


# Examining Fits

Even though we're not using rstanarm anymore, the diagnostics are still the same. 

```{r}
check_hmc_diagnostics(bh_fit)
```

We can also use `shinystan` to explore our fit

---

# Looking at our fits

Let's first examine fit of our estimated spawner recruit data. 

By default, `stan` returns draws from anything defined in `parameters`, `transformed parameters`, and `generated quantities` block

Let's use `tidybayes` to get our fitted and posterior predictive recruits out. 

Note ability of `tidybayes` to deal with variables with more than one value

```{r}

fitted_recruits <-
  tidybayes::gather_draws(bh_fit, recruits_hat[year], pp_rhat[year]) 

head(fitted_recruits,2)

```

---

# Looking at our Fits

Let's calculate the mean and 80% credible interval for each type of prediction over time

```{r}
fitted_recruits <-  fitted_recruits %>% 
  group_by(year, .variable) %>%
  summarise(rhat = mean(.value),
            lower = quantile(.value, 0.1),
            upper = quantile(.value, 0.9)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(year = year + min(flound$year) - 1)


```

---

# Looking at our Fits

And now plot!

Why is the posterior predictive so much wider than the mean prediction?

```{r, echo = FALSE}

fitted_recruits %>% 
  left_join(flound, by = "year") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = flound, aes(ssb, recruits), size = 4, shape = 21, fill = "lightgrey") + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ssb,ymin = lower, ymax = upper, fill = .variable), alpha = 0.25) + 
  geom_line(aes(ssb,rhat,color = .variable)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,NA), name = "SSB") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Recruits") +
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = '', labels = c("Posterior Predictive","Mean Prediction")) + 
    scale_color_discrete(name = '',labels = c("Posterior Predictive","Mean Prediction"))


```

---


# Exercise

* Extract the posterior of the steepness parameter *h*

* Plot the posterior,and compare to the prior

* Try and make the prior more/less informative and compare the prior/posterior plots

# Using your model to make predictions

Often in environmental problems we need to fit our model to one set of data, and predict on others. 

This is pretty easy using `rstanarm` and `brms`, but a bit more challenging using `stan`. 

The recommended option is to allow your model to take different data for the posterior predictive than the fitting data
  - This can be time consuming
  
As an alternative, I recommend using the `algorithm = "Fixed_param"` option, and applying each draw from your posterior to your mode. 

  - See example [here](https://github.com/DanOvando/learn-stan/blob/master/scripts/generate-stan-predictions.R)

# Challenges of Bayes


Bayesian and Frequentist methods both make assumptions that may be more or less valid in different circumstances

- Can be much slower, especially for large models
  - But getting much faster

- Setting priors can be tough
  - Can't set multiple priors on the same thing
  - Make sure prior in the real world means the same thing as the prior in the small world (see [Choy et al. 2009](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/07-1886.1))
  
- Readers may be uncomfortable with it
  - Where's the regression table? **WHERE ARE THE P-VALUES**
  - Always clearly present your priors, and include sensitivity analyses

# Where to learn more?

Bayesian modeling and stan are big and complex topics

  - They can be extremely useful in ecological modeling

  - They're not that scary
