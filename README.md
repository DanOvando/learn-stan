# Learn-Stan
A practical introduction to modeling in Stan

The goal of this document is to get users comfortable writing, diagnosing, and using Stan models. 

There are numerous more detailed resources out there, and any user interested in using Stan in their research
should be sure to read further to really understand what Stan is doing and why. However, many of the available resources
can be daunting to people unfamiliar with the language, or omit key steps in the actual "ok, but how do I really do this" side of things. 

This document is not intended to be a technically perfect explanation or example of the use of Stan, but rather a useful step-by-step 
example for going from raw data to results using R and Stan, that users can build from as they develop their own models
